# Use of context

* only we can consume the context value with the help of useContext
* It helps us to avoiding the usages of nested consumer context.
    so it makes your tasks so easy for context values in components 

*E.g. (useful scenarios)*
 1. Passing or maintaining the language preference of user
 2. Theme based on user's role and authentication
 3. Having some user information like username or is used authenticated or not ...etc.
